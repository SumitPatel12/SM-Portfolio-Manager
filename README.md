# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Manager
First API Used is **nsetools** to get ISIN Code of Stock Solo described in nsetools IPYNB File as well as heavy use of **pandas** to get data
<br>
Scraping data of stock market using **scrapy**, but seems that is not optimized pandas when it comes to **DataFrames**
<br>
Others API can also be used like **yahoofinance** for Stocks of **USA** not productive for India
<br>
Scraping Data is done with moneycontrol sites, 
**Three Jupyter files namely smeet,zeel,sumit contains all the stock data's**
<br>
Using **Kaggle** Csv file contain Stock ticker symbol and ISIN Code's more easily than nsetools
<br>
Not Using **mongodb** becuase **django** inbuilt provides **sqllite3** 
<br>
Regardless Of We have predicted **Infosys** Stock Using **sklearn , Tensorflow**. which is consirderd as **Second-API**
<br>
**3 API is django** for well visulization of Things we have scraped.
